##1.8
### Added
- New interface to Agriculture output, lfs_diet_rice and lfs_fwaste_rice

- Interface to minerals passing on 3 types of population data and new interface to employment. Added new output ports in the 1.1 lifestyles metanode and linked them to Update L2 google node with names 4.2 Minerals and 6.1 Employment. Node runs but the interface with Employment does not show up in the google sheet. Vincent is aware of it.
### Changed
- Some of the input data has been refined (see below some). I advise that for NEXt release to UPDATE ALL of the input data.

- Updates to tra_demand_split_factors.xlsx, ll_lfs_paperpack.xlsx.... etc (see above request to update all inputs).
### Removed
- Nothing
### Fixes
- Abnormal values to transport.

##1.7
### Added
- Final calculation flow for employment with several aggregations of intermediate outputs.
- Glass and aluminium packaging demand
- Two new interfaces with the industry module
### Changed

### Fixes
-  Bug preventing ots values for Czech Republic in output

##1.6
### Added
